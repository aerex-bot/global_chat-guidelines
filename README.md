# Global Chat Information & Guidelines
Welcome to Aerex global chat! We're so happy that you invited Aerex to your server. Before using our global chat, we need to make sure that you and your server understand our rules and guidelines. Failure to follow these rules and guidelines may result in you or your server's global chat privileges being revoked.

## What is a global chat?
A global chat is essentially a system that sends your messages from your designated global chat channel to other servers' global chat channels. Essentially, your messages would reach other servers and other server's messages would reach yours. This would allow you to talk to others who might not be in your server (hence the term global) and get to know each other better!

## How do I set it up?
If you would like to set up the global chat for your server, all you need to do is create a channel named `#aerex-global-chat` and make sure Aerex has the permission to `SEND_MESSAGES`, `EMBED_LINKS`, and `MANAGE_MESSAGES`. That's it! Send your first message in the chat to test it out. If you wish to use the quick-setup feature, you may run the `globalchat` command in any channel and continue by pressing one of the buttons given. If buttons don't show up on the prompt, that means you already have an existing channel named `#aerex-global-chat` and the entire system is already set up. Once you've done that, continue reading this to familiarize yourself with our rules.

## Rules & Guidelines
Before you send your first message in the global chat, we recommend you read these rules and guidelines to make sure you understand what is and is not acceptable. The following are the basics of what we do not allow:
* Do not send **any form** of advertisement in our global chat.
	* This means server invites are *strictly prohibited*.
	* You may not self promote any of your creations (i.e. YouTube Channel, TikTok, Instagram, etc.) in this global chat either.
* Do not send **any form** of malware, spyware, etc.
	* Sending these scam links will result in **you and your server** getting blacklisted.
	* Yes, "Free Nitro" scam links are considered malware.
* Do not spam the system.
	* We have built in ratelimits in place to filter out spam, but abusing these ratelimits will result in consequences.
* Do not upload inappropriate content. The global chat is meant for **safe** content only.
	* You can upload **appropriate** pictures only.
	* Pictures that are inappropriate will result in **you and/or your server** being blacklisted.
* Do not harass, threaten, or target users and/or send any type of slur.
	* For example: racial slurs are not allowed.
* Do not distribute private information about others.
	* This can include things like a person's IP address or their physical address.
	* Doing this will get **you and your server** blacklisted.
* Finally, don't use any bot commands in the global chat.
	* The global chat itself is meant for discussion only - do not use bot commands in this channel.
	* Doing so will result in a warning or a blacklist (for repeated offenders).

## FAQ:
> **Q:** Is it possible to delete a message from the global chat once it's been sent?\
> **A:** Yes. Once you send your message in the global chat, you are given 15 seconds to press the "delete" button - which will stop it from sending everywhere. After those 15 seconds, the "delete" button will disappear. You will not be able to delete your message after that. If you want it to be deleted, you'll need to [join the support server](https://discord.gg/BYuUvE4) and request for your specific message to be deleted manually. Please note, older messages may not be able to be deleted due to Discord's [API limitations](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#bulk-delete-messages).

> **Q:** What are chat moderators and how can I become one?\
> **A:** Chat moderators are moderators from the Aerex server who are responsible for moderating the global chat. Chat moderators delete and suppress messages containing inappropriate content and are responsible for blacklisting servers and/or users that participate frequently in said violating behavior. You can apply for a staff position in Aerex (if they are open). More information is in the [support server](https://discord.gg/BYuUvE4).

> **Q:** Can I request for a message to be deleted?\
> **A:** Yes you can. If it is your message, please [join our support server](https://discord.gg/BYuUvE4) and ask in the #assistance channel. A chat moderator will assist you in deleting your message. If you are a server administrator and want a specific message sent by one of your users to be deleted, you can also follow the same procedure above. Note that we may ask you for proof of your server administrator status.

> **Q:** How can I report someone for sending inappropriate content in the global chat?\
> **A:** To report someone, you can bring it to our attention in the global chat, make it clear that you are reporting someone. You can also [join our support server](https://discord.gg/BYuUvE4) and tell us in the #assistance channel. If you wish to report someone privately, you can let a staff member know in Direct Messages.

> **Q:** How do I appeal a global chat blacklist?\
> **A:** Global chat blacklists can be appealed the same way you appeal a bot blacklist. In order to appeal the blacklist, attempt to run a bot command (such as `a!help`), in which you will be prompted to appeal your blacklist by pressing a button to fill out an embedded Discord form.

### Thanks for using our global chat! We hope you have fun!
